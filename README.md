# Simple-todo-app

This is a basic todo-app which can perform *CRUD* operations.
This single page application is hosted by heroku.

Entries are sanitized using the node dependancy  `sanitize-html` hence links cannot be entries. It is responsive as seen on phone below.
This project is based on a fullstack javascript course from  *Learnwebcode with brad*.
